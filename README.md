# Project Starter Structure

Welcome to the **Project Starter Structure** repository! This project provides a clean, simple, and scalable structure for building modern applications using **TypeScript** and **JSX**. It ensures your app is easy to maintain, grow, and test while promoting consistency and reusability.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:** Each file and folder serves a clear purpose.
- **Reusability:** Build reusable components and utilities.
- **Type Safety:** Fully powered by TypeScript for error-free development.
- **Scalable Design:** Easily extend the project as your app grows.
- **Testing-Friendly:** Simplifies the process of writing and running tests.

## How It Works

### Key Directories

- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components, each with its own `index.tsx` and `styles.tsx` files.
- **`configs/`**: Configuration files for the app.
- **`constants/`**: Application-wide constants such as images and strings.
- **`global/`**: Shared components like loaders and flash messages.
- **`helpers/`**: Utility functions for common tasks like navigation and authentication.
- **`modules/`**: Organized modules for specific app features.
- **`navigator/`**: Navigation logic and stack configurations.
- **`redux/`**: State management files (reducers, sagas, and store).
- **`service/`**: API services and endpoints.
- **`styles/`**: Centralized styling files for themes, typography, and colors.
